## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [react-native-skeleton-content Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [dev@alexandrezajac.com](mailto:dev@alexandrezajac.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for react-native-skeleton-content. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/alexZajac/react-native-skeleton-content/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/alexZajac/react-native-skeleton-content/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for react-native-skeleton-content, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/alexZajac/react-native-skeleton-content/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of react-native-skeleton-content which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most react-native-skeleton-content users.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to react-native-skeleton-content? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain react-native-skeleton-content's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible react-native-skeleton-content
- Enable a sustainable system for react-native-skeleton-content's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

#### Type of Issue and Issue State

| Label name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests. |
| `bug` |  Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs. |

| `help-wanted` | The Freact-native-skeleton-content core team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues. |
| `beginner` |   Less complex issues which would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute to react-native-skeleton-content. |
| `more-information-needed` | More information needs to be collected about these problems or feature requests (e.g. steps to reproduce). |
| `needs-reproduction` |  Likely bugs, but haven't been reliably reproduced. |
| `blocked` | Issues blocked on other issues. |
| `duplicate` | Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before. |
| `wontfix` | The react-native-skeleton-content core team has decided not to fix these issues for now, either because they're working as intended or for some other reason. |
| `invalid` | Issues which aren't valid (e.g. user errors). |

#### Pull Request Labels

| Label name | Description
